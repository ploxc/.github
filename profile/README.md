# Ploxc

Industrial automation deserves better tools. This is a start.

## What Lives Here

### [Modbux](https://github.com/ploxc/modbux)
A Modbus client & server simulation tool born from four years of commissioning frustration. Read, write, scan, and simulate with full datatype support. See every interpretation at once. Test before you're going on-site.

---

## What's Next

Ploxc itself (the language and toolchain) is in active development. More projects will follow as they're ready.

---

## Why Open Source

Because this industry needs better tools, and they should be accessible to everyone.

Built in the trenches. Shared because the next engineer shouldn't fight the same battles.
